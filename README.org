Hodur is a descriptive domain modeling approach and related collection
of libraries for Clojure.

By using Hodur you can define your domain model as data, parse and
validate it, and then either consume your model via an API making your
apps respond to the defined model or use one of the many plugins to
help you achieve mechanical, repetitive results faster and in a purely
functional manner.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This Hodur plugin provides the ability to generate [[https://contentful.com][Contentful]] schemas
out of your Hodur model. You can then apply your schema to your
Contentful environments.
#+END_QUOTE

* Motivation

  For a deeper insight into the motivations behind Hodur, check the
  [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine/blob/master/docs/MOTIVATION.org][motivation doc]].

* Getting Started

  Hodur has a highly modular architecture. [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine][Hodur Engine]] is always
  required as it provides the meta-database functions and APIs
  consumed by plugins.

  Therefore, refer the [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#getting-started][Hodur Engine's Getting Started]] first and then
  return here for Contentful-specific setup.

  After having set up ~hodur-engine~ as described above, we also need
  to add ~hodur/contentful-schema~, the plugin that creates Contentful
  Schemas out of your model to the ~deps.edn~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:deps {hodur/engine            {:mvn/version "0.1.4"}
          hodur/contentful-schema {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}}
#+END_SRC

  You should ~require~ it any way you see fit:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (require '[hodur-engine.core :as hodur])
  (require '[hodur-contentful-schema.core :as hodur-contentful])
#+END_SRC

  Let's expand our ~Person~ model from the original getting started by
  "tagging" the ~Person~ entity for Contentful. You can read more about
  the concept of tagging for plugins in the sessions below but, in
  short, this is the way we, model designers, use to specify which
  entities we want to be exposed to which plugins.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def meta-db (hodur/init-schema
                '[^{:contentful/tag-recursive true}
                  Person
                  [^String first-name
                   ^String last-name]]))
#+END_SRC

  The ~hodur-contentful-schema~ plugin exposes a function called ~schema~
  that generates your model as a Contentful schema payload:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def contentful-schema (hodur-contentful/schema meta-db {:space-id "<YOUR_SPACE_ID>"))
#+END_SRC

  You should replace `<YOUR_SPACE_ID>` with the space id of your
  Contentful instance.

  When you inspect ~contentful-schema~, this is what you have:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "contentTypes" : [ {
      "sys" : {
        "space" : {
          "sys" : {
            "type" : "Link",
            "linkType" : "Space",
            "id" : "<YOUR_SPACE_ID>"
          }
        },
        "id" : "person",
        "type" : "ContentType",
        "publishedVersion" : 1
      },
      "name" : "Person",
      "description" : null,
      "fields" : [ {
        "id" : "firstName",
        "name" : "First Name",
        "type" : "Symbol",
        "localized" : false,
        "required" : true,
        "validations" : [ ],
        "omitted" : false,
        "disabled" : false
      }, {
        "id" : "lastName",
        "name" : "Last Name",
        "type" : "Symbol",
        "localized" : false,
        "required" : true,
        "validations" : [ ],
        "omitted" : false,
        "disabled" : false
      } ]
    } ],
    "editorInterfaces" : [ {
      "sys" : {
        "id" : "default",
        "type" : "EditorInterface",
        "space" : {
          "sys" : {
            "type" : "Link",
            "linkType" : "Space",
            "id" : "<YOUR_SPACE_ID>"
          }
        },
        "contentType" : {
          "sys" : {
            "id" : "person",
            "type" : "Link",
            "linkType" : "ContentType"
          }
        }
      },
      "controls" : [ {
        "fieldId" : "firstName",
        "widgetId" : "singleLine"
      }, {
        "fieldId" : "lastName",
        "widgetId" : "singleLine"
      } ]
    } ]
  }
#+END_SRC

  In order to import the model above to your Contentful space, first
  make sure you have [[https://nodejs.org/en/][NodeJS installed]], then save the JSON returned
  from ~schema~ to a file (i.e. ~my-model.json~).

  You will also need your Contentful settings to either on a
  ~contentful-config.json~ file to run the [[https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/import-and-export/][Contentful CLI]]. More info
  on the [[https://github.com/contentful/contentful-import/blob/master/example-config.json][config file here]]. For the purposes of this getting started,
  I'm using something along the lines of:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "spaceId": "<YOUR_SPACE_ID>",
  "managementToken": "<YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN>"
}
#+END_SRC

  Then you can run the importer with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ npx contentful-cli space import --config contentful-config.json --content-file my-model.json
#+END_SRC

  You can also specify the environment you are importing the model to
  with the parameter ~--environment-id~.

* Model Definition

  All Hodur plugins follow the [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#model-definition][Model Definition]] as described on Hodur
  [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#model-definition][Engine's documentation]].

* Setting Display Name

  The display name of entities and fields can be controlled by using
  the marker ~:contentful/display-name~:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [^{:contentful/display-name "My Dream List"}
   Dream
   [^{:contentful/display-name "The Dream Title"}
    title]]
#+END_SRC

  If no ~:contentful/display-name~ is provided, the plugin will
  default to a capitalized version of the entity or field name.

* Making a Field the Display of an Entity

  Contentful uses one of the fields of each entity as a visual
  identifier for editors on its admin interface.

  In order to specify which field is used for it, mark it with
  ~:contentful/display-field true~.

* Documenting Entities and Fields

  The marker ~:doc~ is fully supported. Both entity and field
  documentations will show on the admin for editors.

* Specifying Contentful Types

  Contentful-specific types can be specified by using the marker
  ~:contentful/type~.

  The supported basic types are:

  + ~Symbol~ (short text - default for ~String~)
  + ~Text~ (long text)
  + ~Integer~ (default for ~Integer~)
  + ~Number~ (default for ~Float~)
  + ~Date~ (default for ~DateTime~)
  + ~Boolean~ (default for ~Boolean~)
  + ~Object~
  + ~Location~
  + ~RichText~

  In general you don't need to specify the following ones because they
  are managed internally by the plugin but, for reference:

  + ~Array~ (default for any multiple ~cardinality~)
  + ~Link~ (default for linking to one asset and other user-specified entities)

  Last but not least, you can also specify ~Asset~ as a special type
  that will point to an asset (or more if cardinality is many) on the
  digital asset manager:

  + ~Asset~

* Asset Fields

  By specifying ~:contentful/type "Asset"~ you are letting Contentful
  know that a certain field should be associated with and asset from
  the digital asset manager.

  This field can also have cardinality of many (~[0 n]~) and it should
  let editors choose several assets for it.

  Please refer to the section describing [[#field-validations][further validations down
  below]] for examples on how to limit to certain kind of assets (images
  for instance) and certain image features.

  Also, refer to the [[#choosing-widget-for-fields][widget configuration below]] as there are different
  widgets that can be used for asset selection.

* ID Fields

  ~ID~ fields are sent to Contentful as ~Symbol~ by default. Please do
  provide a different ~:contentful/type~ if you need something else.

  In addition, ~ID~ fields are automatically marked as unique by
  default. If you prefer to control this more granularly, use a more
  basic data type (~String~ i.e.) and detail your validations manually
  as documented in the section below.

* Enum Fields

  Fields that point to ~:enum~ entities will be sent to Contentful as
  ~Symbol~ by default. If you need a different type, please provide it
  via ~:contentful/type~.

  By default the values of the enum are used as an ~:in~ validation
  for the field. Therefore, the editor will be constrained to select
  one of the options.

  A ~dropdown~ widget is chosen by default in order to help editors
  understand the selection. If you prefer a different rendering (such
  as a ~radio~ or a ~singleLine~) you can specify it with the
  ~:contentful/widget-id~ marker as documented in the respective
  section below.

* Field Validations

  This plugin acts as a pass-through to the validations specified on
  marker ~:contentful/validations~. This marker, when specified, must
  be an array of at least one entry. The full documentation of all the
  [[https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/content-types/content-type][field validations available on Contentful can be found here]].

  Here's an example showing some of these combined. They are pretty
  self-explanatory:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

* Choosing Widget for Fields

  In order to make the experience more interesting for editors,
  Contentful supports several dedicated widgets. A widget for a field
  can be specified with the marker ~:contentful/widget-id~. If a
  widget is not specified a reasonable default one will be selected.

  A full list of the [[https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/editor-interfaces/][available widgets can be found here]]. As of this
  writing, the options are:

| Widget ID          | Applicable field types        | Description                                                                                                     |

  Here's a simple example:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [MarketingEntry
   [^{:type String
      :contentful/widget-id "urlEditor"} url
    ^{:type Integer
      :contentful/widget-id "rating"}    stars]]
#+END_SRC

* Widget Settings

  With the exception of the help text, all other widget settings are
  available via Hodur with specific markers.

  For ~boolean~ widget:

  + ~:contentful/true-label~ : Shows this text next to the radio
    button that sets this value to ~true~. Defaults to "Yes".
  + ~:contentful/false-label~ : Shows this text next to the radio
    button that sets this value to ~false~. Defaults to "No".

  For ~rating~ widget:

  + ~:contentful/stars~ : Number of stars to select from. Defaults
    to 5.

  For ~datePicker~ widget:

  + ~:contentful/format~ : One of "dateonly", "time", "timeZ"
    (default). Specifies whether to show the clock and/or timezone

  + ~:contentful/ampm~ : Specifies which type of clock to use. Must be
    one of the strings "12" or "24" (default).

  Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [Entity
   [^{:type Integer
      :contentful/widget-id "rating"
      :contentful/stars 10}
    stars-field

    ^{:type Boolean
      :contentful/true-label "Si!"
      :contentful/false-label "No!"}
    si-o-no-field

    ^{:type DateTime
      :contentful/format "dateonly"}
    date-only-field

    ^{:type DateTime
      :contentful/format "time"}
    time-field

    ^{:type DateTime
      :contentful/format "timeZ"}
    full-date-time-field

    ^{:type DateTime
      :contentful/ampm "12"}
    american-style-time-field]]
#+END_SRC

* Limitations & Assumptions

  + This plugin ignores ~interfaces~ and field parameters.
  + ~PascalCasing~ is used on naming entities and ~camelCasing~ is
    used on all fields
  + There are no validations on the widgets, validations, or other
    Contentful-specific markers. They are simply passed over to
    Contentful.
  + Unions are supported by creating entry relationships that support
    multiple content types.
